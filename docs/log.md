# Working log

Record what was expected vs. what actually happened as work proceeds. One
section per milestone. See `docs/SCOPE.md` for the milestone definitions.

## M0 — Corpus collection

**Expected:** manually click through each wiki's Special:Statistics page to
check/request dumps, per the raw SCOPE.md description.

**Actual:** automated the check/download/extract steps instead of the manual
click-through, with one deliberate exception. Findings:

- Fandom's wiki pages (`*.fandom.com/wiki/...`) are behind a Cloudflare JS
  challenge — plain scripted GET/HEAD requests get a 403 "Just a moment..."
  page, not real content.
- `*.fandom.com/api.php` (MediaWiki API) is *not* behind that challenge, and
  returns each wiki's `wikiid` (dbname) and page count as JSON.
- Actual dump files live on a public S3 bucket at a deterministic path
  derived from the dbname: `s3://wikia_xml_dumps/{c}/{cc}/{dbname}_pages_current.xml.7z`.
  This is also not behind Cloudflare, and HEAD requests return size,
  last-modified, storage class, and an MD5 checksum (`x-amz-meta-md5`) —
  enough to check status and verify downloads without ever touching the
  Cloudflare-protected pages.
- Requesting a *new* dump (for wikis with none) requires an
  autoconfirmed-or-higher Fandom account on that specific wiki — not
  something a script can do. Left as a manual step by design (see
  `scripts/check_fandom_dumps.py`'s docstring).
- Initial version of the storage-class check was wrong: it treated every
  class other than `STANDARD` as needing an S3 Glacier-style restore before
  download. Only `GLACIER`/`DEEP_ARCHIVE` actually require that —
  `STANDARD_IA` serves a normal ranged GET immediately. Caught this by
  testing a ranged GET directly against a `STANDARD_IA` object (got `206
  Partial Content`) before trusting the first pass. Fixed in both
  `check_fandom_dumps.py` and `download_fandom_dumps.py`.
- Built three scripts: `scripts/check_fandom_dumps.py` (status via API +
  S3 HEAD), `scripts/download_fandom_dumps.py` (resumable, checksum-verified
  download), `scripts/extract_fandom_corpus.py` (7z decompress +
  wikiextractor → plaintext, reports total GB against the 1-5GB target).
  Added `wikiextractor` to `pyproject.toml` dependencies (needed now, not a
  later milestone).
- Of the 45 candidate wikis in `scripts/fandom_wikis.txt`: 23 have a dump
  ready to download immediately (~1.93 GB compressed), 18 need a Glacier/Deep
  Archive restore first, 3 have no dump yet (need a manual request via
  Special:Statistics), 1 subdomain guess was wrong (`fullmetalalchemist`
  404s — needs the correct subdomain).
- `p7zip-full` is not installed and this environment has no passwordless
  `sudo`, so `extract_fandom_corpus.py` is untested end-to-end — install
  with `sudo apt-get install -y p7zip-full` to unblock it.
- Downloaded and checksum-verified all 23 ready-now dumps (~1.8 GB on disk).
  `p7zip-full` was then installed manually; running `extract_fandom_corpus.py`
  against the real data caught a real bug: it invoked `python` for
  wikiextractor, which doesn't exist on PATH here (only `python3` /
  the venv's `python`) — fixed by using `sys.executable`.
- Requested dumps for the 21 wikis needing one (18 archived + 3 missing) is
  blocked on the new Fandom account reaching the 4-day (96h) autoconfirmed
  threshold — Fandom's autoconfirmed rule is account age only, no edit
  requirement, and it's global across all wikis on one account.
- Ran `extract_fandom_corpus.py` against the real 23 dumps and caught a
  second real bug: 7z preserves whatever permission bits are stored in the
  archive verbatim, and the "disney" dump's stored bits were `000`
  (unreadable even by the owner) — decompressed fine, then wikiextractor
  hit `PermissionError` trying to open it. Fixed by chmod'ing the extracted
  XML to `rw-------` right after decompression, before handing it to
  wikiextractor.
- Result: all 23 wikis extracted to plaintext, **0.961 GB total** — just
  under SCOPE's 1-5GB target lower bound. Expected to grow well past it
  once the 21 pending wikis land.
- Pre-fetched the raw files for the other 3 embedding spaces (GloVe 6B,
  Numberbatch English 19.08, Wikipedia2Vec 300d text) via
  `scripts/download_embeddings.py`, ahead of M2/M4's actual milestone
  order — justified the same way as M0's early start (large, latency-bound,
  no code dependency), confirmed with the user first since SCOPE.md
  sequences these after M1. Only raw files staged in
  `data/embeddings/raw/`; no tensor-building code written.
- All 3 downloads completed and sha256-recorded (no official checksums are
  published by any of the three sources, so these sidecar hashes are only
  useful for detecting local corruption on re-run, not verifying against a
  canonical value): `glove.6B.zip` (862 MB, zip integrity checked with
  `zipfile.testzip()` — contains 50d/100d/200d/300d), `numberbatch-en-19.08.txt.gz`
  (325 MB), `enwiki_20180420_300d.txt.bz2` (2559 MB). Total ~3.7 GB raw.
  Throughput was much lower than the Fandom S3 downloads (~1.5 MB/s vs.
  ~21 MB/s) — bottlenecked by the source servers (Stanford, S3 buckets
  outside the fast one), not local bandwidth.

## M1 — Board and legality

**Expected:** straightforward per SCOPE.md's description — Board class,
`is_legal_clue()`, pytest coverage of the listed edge cases.

**Actual:** matched expectations, plus two decisions worth recording:

- Board vocabulary: no source was specified in SCOPE.md beyond "~800
  Codenames card words." Used the 400-word base-game list from
  [sagelga/codenames](https://github.com/sagelga/codenames)
  (`wordlist/en-EN/default`, itself sourced from two other open
  implementations) — verified as 400 unique words, no duplicates, and it
  naturally includes multi-word entries ("Ice cream", "New york", "Loch
  ness", "Scuba diver") which became real test fixtures rather than
  synthetic ones. Checked in at `codenames/assets/board_words.txt` (a
  package asset, not `data/` — that's for gitignored raw dumps). 400 words
  is half of SCOPE's "~800" figure; expansions would need to be added
  later if that matters, but wasn't blocking for M1.
- Legality's "morphological variants" rule: substring-containment already
  covers regular English suffixation for free (plural -s/-es, -ing, -ed
  are all concatenative, so "apple" ⊂ "apples" as strings). The only
  common gap is a stem-spelling change before a suffix -- y→i ("happy" /
  "happier", "city" / "cities") -- so `_stem_variants()` adds just that one
  extra form per word rather than pulling in a stemmer/lemmatizer library.
  Deliberately narrow: won't catch irregular forms (mouse/mice, go/went).
  Chosen over a real stemmer because SCOPE explicitly flags that legality
  bugs "silently inflate every downstream score" -- a small,
  fully-enumerable rule set that's easy to write precise tests against
  beats broader but less predictable coverage from a black-box stemmer.
- `codenames/board.py` + `tests/test_board.py`, 23 tests, all passing:
  board generation (determinism per seed, role counts, no duplicate
  words), reveal/role-query behavior, and legality (exact match, case
  insensitivity, plurals both directions, the y→i stem case, hyphenated
  board words, multi-word board entries).

## M2 — GloVe and similarity tensor

**Expected:** download script, clue vocab filter, mmap tensor build,
similarity.py loader, sanity check. Per SCOPE.md's own warning, treat the
sanity check as a gate, not a formality.

**Actual:** matched expectations. Notes:

- The "download script with resume and checksum verification" requirement
  was already satisfied by `scripts/download_embeddings.py` (built during
  the M0 session when GloVe/Numberbatch/Wikipedia2Vec raw files were
  pre-fetched) — no separate GloVe-specific downloader needed.
- "Frequency threshold (CLI arg)" is implemented as a rank cutoff, not an
  external frequency source. Verified empirically that GloVe 6B's vocab
  file is frequency-descending ordered (first entries: "the", ",", ".",
  "of" ...; last entries: junk/rare tokens) — so line index doubles as
  frequency rank for free. Filtering to purely lowercase-alphabetic tokens
  (317,756 of the 400,000 total) and taking the top `--vocab-size` (default
  250,000) of those lands exactly on SCOPE's ~250k target with zero new
  dependencies. Avoided pulling in an external word-frequency library
  (e.g. `wordfreq`) for this reason.
- Board vocabulary has 4 multi-word/hyphenated entries ("Ice cream", "Loch
  ness", "New york", "Scuba diver") that have no single GloVe token.
  Resolved via mean-pooling the constituent words' vectors (a standard
  technique for representing short phrases with single-word embeddings) —
  verified first that every constituent word of every multi-word entry
  exists in GloVe's vocab, so no silent fallback was needed. All other 396
  board words matched a GloVe token directly. This mean-pooling approach
  will need to be repeated for each additional space in M4 (each space's
  own vocab may have different multi-word gaps).
- `codenames/similarity.py`: mmap loader over a `(n_clues, n_board_words,
  n_spaces)` fp16 tensor — the `n_spaces` axis exists now (size 1, just
  "glove") specifically so M4 can append space-slices without changing
  this interface, per SCOPE.md §2's exact tensor shape ordering.
- Build run: 250,000 clues × 400 board words × 1 space, 200MB on disk,
  9.9s wall time end-to-end (8.8s just loading the raw 400k-row GloVe
  file), 0.5s for the actual GPU similarity compute, peak VRAM 0.12GB —
  trivial at this scale; expect this to matter more once M4 adds 3 more
  spaces and the board vocabulary grows.
- Ran `scripts/sanity_check_sims.py` and eyeballed it per SCOPE's
  instruction not to skip this. Results were clean and semantically
  correct across the board: King → queen/prince/monarch/throne; Shark →
  whale/dolphin/crocodile; Spy → espionage/CIA/KGB/Mossad; Egypt →
  egyptian/syria/cairo (all correctly self-matching at exactly 1.0000);
  New york (multi-word/mean-pooled) → york/new (its own parts, expected)
  then manhattan/jersey/brooklyn/boston — no signs of index misalignment.
  Caught one bug in the process: the script's own hardcoded sample word
  list used the wrong casing (lowercase "king" vs. the wordlist's actual
  "King") and silently reported false "NOT IN BOARD VOCABULARY" skips —
  bug was in the sanity script's sample list, not the tensor/loader; fixed
  by matching the asset file's actual Title Case.
- `tests/test_similarity.py`: 12 tests against a small synthetic
  hand-built tensor fixture (not the real GloVe-derived one) — keeps tests
  fast and independent of the large downloads, same principle as
  `test_board.py`'s determinism tests.
- Also caught: the package wasn't actually pip-installed (`pip install -e
  .` had never been run, despite being in the README setup steps), so
  `scripts/sanity_check_sims.py` failed on `import codenames` until fixed.
- Follow-up after the casing bug above: made board-word lookups fully
  case-insensitive everywhere, matching `is_legal_clue()` which already
  normalized case. Fixed in three places: `Board._card()` (backs
  `role_of`/`reveal`/`is_revealed`), `SimilarityTensor`'s `board_index`
  (backs `similarity`/`similarities_for_board`/`top_clues`), and
  `sanity_check_sims.py`'s own pre-check (which had been reaching into
  `board_index` directly instead of going through the case-insensitive
  API — same class of bug one layer up). This also surfaced a second
  latent bug while fixing the first: `Board.reveal()` was storing the
  *caller's* casing in the `revealed` set rather than the card's
  canonical casing, so `reveal("king")` followed by `is_revealed("King")`
  would have disagreed. Fixed by having `reveal()` store `card.word`.
  4 new regression tests added across `test_board.py`/`test_similarity.py`
  (39 total, all passing).
