# Working log

Record what was expected vs. what actually happened as work proceeds. One
section per milestone. See `docs/SCOPE.md` for the milestone definitions.

## M0 — Corpus collection

**Expected:** manually click through each wiki's Special:Statistics page to
check/request dumps, per the raw SCOPE.md description.

**Actual:** automated the check/download/extract steps instead of the manual
click-through, with one deliberate exception. Findings:

- Fandom's wiki pages (`*.fandom.com/wiki/...`) are behind a Cloudflare JS
  challenge — plain scripted GET/HEAD requests get a 403 "Just a moment..."
  page, not real content.
- `*.fandom.com/api.php` (MediaWiki API) is *not* behind that challenge, and
  returns each wiki's `wikiid` (dbname) and page count as JSON.
- Actual dump files live on a public S3 bucket at a deterministic path
  derived from the dbname: `s3://wikia_xml_dumps/{c}/{cc}/{dbname}_pages_current.xml.7z`.
  This is also not behind Cloudflare, and HEAD requests return size,
  last-modified, storage class, and an MD5 checksum (`x-amz-meta-md5`) —
  enough to check status and verify downloads without ever touching the
  Cloudflare-protected pages.
- Requesting a *new* dump (for wikis with none) requires an
  autoconfirmed-or-higher Fandom account on that specific wiki — not
  something a script can do. Left as a manual step by design (see
  `scripts/check_fandom_dumps.py`'s docstring).
- Initial version of the storage-class check was wrong: it treated every
  class other than `STANDARD` as needing an S3 Glacier-style restore before
  download. Only `GLACIER`/`DEEP_ARCHIVE` actually require that —
  `STANDARD_IA` serves a normal ranged GET immediately. Caught this by
  testing a ranged GET directly against a `STANDARD_IA` object (got `206
  Partial Content`) before trusting the first pass. Fixed in both
  `check_fandom_dumps.py` and `download_fandom_dumps.py`.
- Built three scripts: `scripts/check_fandom_dumps.py` (status via API +
  S3 HEAD), `scripts/download_fandom_dumps.py` (resumable, checksum-verified
  download), `scripts/extract_fandom_corpus.py` (7z decompress +
  wikiextractor → plaintext, reports total GB against the 1-5GB target).
  Added `wikiextractor` to `pyproject.toml` dependencies (needed now, not a
  later milestone).
- Of the 45 candidate wikis in `scripts/fandom_wikis.txt`: 23 have a dump
  ready to download immediately (~1.93 GB compressed), 18 need a Glacier/Deep
  Archive restore first, 3 have no dump yet (need a manual request via
  Special:Statistics), 1 subdomain guess was wrong (`fullmetalalchemist`
  404s — needs the correct subdomain).
- `p7zip-full` is not installed and this environment has no passwordless
  `sudo`, so `extract_fandom_corpus.py` is untested end-to-end — install
  with `sudo apt-get install -y p7zip-full` to unblock it.
- Downloaded and checksum-verified all 23 ready-now dumps (~1.8 GB on disk).
  `p7zip-full` was then installed manually; running `extract_fandom_corpus.py`
  against the real data caught a real bug: it invoked `python` for
  wikiextractor, which doesn't exist on PATH here (only `python3` /
  the venv's `python`) — fixed by using `sys.executable`.
- Requested dumps for the 21 wikis needing one (18 archived + 3 missing) is
  blocked on the new Fandom account reaching the 4-day (96h) autoconfirmed
  threshold — Fandom's autoconfirmed rule is account age only, no edit
  requirement, and it's global across all wikis on one account.
- Ran `extract_fandom_corpus.py` against the real 23 dumps and caught a
  second real bug: 7z preserves whatever permission bits are stored in the
  archive verbatim, and the "disney" dump's stored bits were `000`
  (unreadable even by the owner) — decompressed fine, then wikiextractor
  hit `PermissionError` trying to open it. Fixed by chmod'ing the extracted
  XML to `rw-------` right after decompression, before handing it to
  wikiextractor.
- Result: all 23 wikis extracted to plaintext, **0.961 GB total** — just
  under SCOPE's 1-5GB target lower bound. Expected to grow well past it
  once the 21 pending wikis land.
- Pre-fetched the raw files for the other 3 embedding spaces (GloVe 6B,
  Numberbatch English 19.08, Wikipedia2Vec 300d text) via
  `scripts/download_embeddings.py`, ahead of M2/M4's actual milestone
  order — justified the same way as M0's early start (large, latency-bound,
  no code dependency), confirmed with the user first since SCOPE.md
  sequences these after M1. Only raw files staged in
  `data/embeddings/raw/`; no tensor-building code written.
- All 3 downloads completed and sha256-recorded (no official checksums are
  published by any of the three sources, so these sidecar hashes are only
  useful for detecting local corruption on re-run, not verifying against a
  canonical value): `glove.6B.zip` (862 MB, zip integrity checked with
  `zipfile.testzip()` — contains 50d/100d/200d/300d), `numberbatch-en-19.08.txt.gz`
  (325 MB), `enwiki_20180420_300d.txt.bz2` (2559 MB). Total ~3.7 GB raw.
  Throughput was much lower than the Fandom S3 downloads (~1.5 MB/s vs.
  ~21 MB/s) — bottlenecked by the source servers (Stanford, S3 buckets
  outside the fast one), not local bandwidth.
